# Drupal Drush

[Drush](https://www.drush.org/) is a command-line shell and scripting interface for Drupal. It makes my life a lot easier because I don't have to manage all the websites from Drupal's admin pages, but I can give commands to the server's command line.

This little script updates all the websites in a certain directory.
